If the product has a UPC code, it will show up on the Seller Central app. If you can't find it by the barcode, you can try scanning the product using a photo. Take a photo of the product, go to add product in the app, and scan the photo. Amazon will then show you options of items with similar photos. Another way is to search by typing the product name. For example, if you type 'Cover FX,' Amazon will show you all the items listed with that name. You can also search on Google by typing the product name along with 'Amazon' to see if there are any listings. Remember, don't just rely on the barcode. Some profitable products may not be found that way, especially seasonal items. Explore different options like using photos, names, Google, and Amazon search. Don't give up easily, because what's hard for you to find is also hard for competitors. The best products are often not easily found. Keep searching and expanding your search methods.",

You can then resell these products on Amazon as is or create bundles. The key factors in deciding between FBA and FBM are your profit margin, time availability, and space availability, not the source of the product. Retail arbitrage involves buying from retail stores and reselling on Amazon after physically visiting the store. It is important to understand that the decision between FBA and FBM is more about cost, profit, time, and space rather than the source of the product. Retail arbitrage involves scanning products in stores like Ross using your phone to find profitable items. Tips and insights on retail arbitrage will be shared based on experience in the next class.",

Firstly, searching by barcode is the simplest method, but not all products have barcodes or accurate UPC codes. Seasonal items or bundled products may not be found this way. Secondly, using the product photo to search on the Amazon app can yield similar product options. Thirdly, manually searching the product name on the Amazon app can provide detailed listings. If unsuccessful, using Google to search the product name alongside Amazon can be helpful. Remember to verify product details such as size and color. These methods are essential for successful product research in retail arbitrage.",

    "content": "The Resale Certificate is a document that allows businesses to make purchases without paying sales tax with the intention of reselling the products. It is particularly beneficial in the United States where sales tax is only paid once by the final consumer. To apply for a Resale Certificate, businesses need to have a registered company and request it from the state where they operate. Once obtained, businesses can buy products for resale without including sales tax in their costs. The responsibility then falls on the business to collect and remit the sales tax when selling to the end consumer. Renewal of the certificate is required annually, and businesses must report sales even if no tax was collected. Having a Resale Certificate can save businesses from paying sales tax twice and requires proper accounting practices to ensure compliance.",

Storage Volume refers to the size of the inventory allowed by Amazon, with limits for Standard Size, Oversized Storage, Apparel, Footwear, and Extra Large Storage. Additionally, Flammable Storage is discussed for items like aerosols. Monitoring Stock Limits and Storage Volume can be done in the Shipments section on Amazon Seller Central. It's important to note that inventory counts even if items are in transit. Managing Stock Level effectively involves rotating inventory to maintain sales velocity.

You can either convert a single FBM item to FBA or list it directly as FBA through Seller Central. Remember that when an item is listed as FBA, you can only change the price, not the quantity. To convert an FBM item to FBA, go to 'Manage Inventory' on the page and select 'Fulfillment by Amazon' to make the conversion. You can filter your inventory by status (active, inactive, etc.) to easily find the items you are looking for. It's important to note that when an item is listed as FBA, the shipping cost is included, unlike FBM where you need to pay for shipping separately. The class demonstrates converting an FBM item to FBA using the example of 'Cover FX Natural Finish' product. By converting to FBA, you can benefit from lower shipping costs and simplified inventory management. To convert an item from FBM to FBA, go to 'Edit' and select 'Change to Fulfill by Amazon'.

This allows people living outside the US to sell on the Amazon US marketplace. You can manage your purchases and sales from anywhere, even if you're traveling. Online Arbitrage involves using systems to search for products to buy from retail stores and resell on Amazon. You can choose to fulfill orders through FBM or FBA. For those living outside the US, working with FBA is more feasible due to Prep Centers offering cost-effective preparation services. It's recommended to work with a Prep Center that handles both FBA and FBM to avoid missing out on sales spikes, especially during peak seasons like November and December. Online Arbitrage is a convenient way to buy products from retail stores worldwide and resell them on Amazon, either through FBA or FBM. Make sure to plan ahead for seasonal items that may require FBM fulfillment. See you in the next class!",

It's important to explore all possible listings for a product, including bundles or multiple items, to maximize selling opportunities. By expanding our search to include products from the same brand, we can uncover more potential listings and opportunities for resale.

The second way is to check competitor stores through Amazon, see what they are reselling, and then search on Google to find where to buy. I recommend this method as it is very efficient. Another approach is to use research tools such as tactical arbitrage and Source Mogoul. I personally prefer tactical arbitrage as it offers a wider range of filters. Within tactical arbitrage, you can refine your filters, use competitor store reverse search, and utilize tools like the tactical expander. By combining Keepa Finder with tactical arbitrage, you can enhance your product sourcing capabilities. These methods have taken my online product sourcing to the next level.

It's important to think creatively when sourcing from these stores, such as breaking down bulk items into smaller bundles for different Amazon listings. Target is good but doesn't like resellers. Marshall's, TJ Maxx, and Burlington offer affordable products, but be cautious as some receipts may lack item descriptions. Outlets like Nike and Adidas also provide discounted items.

For brand unlocking, only the invoice is required, while for category unlocking, photos of all four sides of the product along with the invoice are needed. The process involves submitting the invoice and, if necessary, additional product photos to Amazon for approval. It's important to ensure the information on the invoice matches the Amazon account details.
